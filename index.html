        <h1>Information</h1>
        <p>This map was created by Archika Dogra, Emily Lee, Jenny Zhang, and Harish Bommakanti as part of the 2018 NASA SEES
        Internship in Austin, Texas under the mentorship of Mr. Brent Porter. It is intended to contextualize precipitation
        data with demographic information and other weather trends, ultimately serving as a Flood Response Resource.</p>
        <h2>Left Side Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p> Under Layer Toggles you can turn layers describing poverty demographics, population density, soil moisture,
            and lake levels on and off. Lake levels are updated every day.</p>
        <p>Under Opacity Sliders you can change the visibility of the individual layers, with right-most being the strongest visibility.</p>
        <P>Under Basemap options there is a drop down menu that presents 11 different options for the basemap.</P>
        <h2>Right Side Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p> Quantitative Precipitation Estimates in inches for three different dates are available. Check the checkbox to turn on the layer type, and move the date
            slider in order to change the layer shown. The opacity slider controls the visibility of the layer when turned on.</p>
        <p> Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts in inches for the listed dates are available. Check the checkbox to turn on the layer type, and move the date
                slider in order to change the layer shown. The opacity slider controls the visibility of the layer when turned on.</p>

        <h5>Some layers include pop-ups with more information about the regions you clicked on and offer more specific data than the legends. These
        layers include poverty, lake levels, QPE, and QPF data.</h5>

        <h1>Meet the Team!</h1>
        <h2>Jenny Zhang (2019)</h2>
        <p>Jenny Zhang is an aspiring computer scientist and roboticist from Austin, Texas, who maintains a STEM YouTube channel 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxniypszfDKwHYhlCfRxjA" target="_blank">Origin Studios</a>)
            about anything from LEGOs and Rubik's Cubes to physics tutorials. As the Simplified Chinese advocate for Khan Academy, 
            she  manages a translation effort to bring a "world-class education to anyone, anywhere", and writes programs for the international 
            language advocate community to help other teams increase workflow efficiency. She is the President of Engineering Club, Webmaster of STEM Academy Ambassadors,
            and Treasurer of Mu Alpha Theta at Westwood High School, and represents her school in UIL Computer Science. She is also the Student Lead for a research effort 
            to find free quarks with Mr.Paul Hudspeth and Dr.Tim Urban using a modification of Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment, and has created technical drawings and 
            computer simulations. In her free time, she loves to make puns, NXT robots, animations, and CAD models, 
            as well as geek out over Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars.</p>
        <h2>Emily Lee (2019)</h2>
        <p>Emily Lee is a senior at Lowell High School in San Francisco, California. A peer mentor and a member of her school’s 
            honor society, she is active in Lowell's FIRST Robotics Competition Team, where she specializes in programming subsystems, teaches rookies how to program in Java, and helps assemble electronics and controllers on robots.  Over the past five years, she has volunteered at the San Francisco Zoo, caring for animals and restoring local habitats. In 2016, her essay submission for JPL/NASA's "Cassini Scientist For a Day" competition was selected as the national winner for Grades 9-12 for her subject. During her spare time, she likes to participate in local hackathons, play video games, and draw random plants. She hopes to pursue a career that balances her love for computers, environmental science, or space exploration.</p>
        <h2>Archika Dogra (2020)</h2>
        <p>Archika Dogra attends Interlake High School in Seattle, Washington. Alongside being an NASA intern for the SEES program,
            Archika has interned in machine learning labs at Stanford University and the University of Washington. In her school,
            Archika is the President of Technology Student Association, Secretary of AI Club, and an avid participant of
            National Science Honor Society. She also runs The EduSTEM Initiative, an international organization educating,
            encouraging, and empowering minorities in STEM to explore science and technology as a future career path. Archika is passionate
            about diversity and inclusivity in STEM, all-world feminism, and writing. In her free time
            she likes to create mobile applications, play softball, debate, watch dance videos, and pet dogs.</p>
        <h2>Harish Bommakanti (2020)</h2>
        <p>Harish Bommakanti is the top of his class at Rouse High School in Leander, Texas. A current junior, Harish found
        that his interests lie mainly in computer science, math, and physics. He participates as the Software lead of
        his robotics team of his high school, making it to world championships in his freshman year. Additionally he
        participates in UIL math and computer science competitions at Rouse. In the NASA SEES internship, Harish was able to extend his
        coding expertise and learn more about data science with top notch staff at the UT Austin Center for Space Research. He
        plans to apply for more NASA opportunities such as the High School Aerospace Scholars Program. In the future, Harish plans
        to major in engineering. </p>
        <h2>Brent Porter (????)</h2>
        <p>Brent Porter is a SEES Project Scientist and Mentor to SEES Interns. He also works at the Center for Space Research with 
            the Emergency Response Group - the Institute for Disaster Analytics. There he is an application developer, system architect 
            and technical lead. He is very interested in spatial applications that can provide and integrate real-time data and machine
            learning. In his free time he likes to run trails with his dog, spend time with his family and write.</p>
